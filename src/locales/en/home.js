Being lonely isn’t just a feeling. It is proven to be bad for you. Loneliness affects us all. It doesn’t discriminate, regardless of your age.<br/><br/> 
How does it work?<br/><br/>
Mitein looks to connect you to people you’d would otherwise never have the fortune of chatting to. Partnering with a number of care homes around Berlin, we will schedule a time for you.<br/><br/> 
Looking to learn German?<br/><br/> 
Wanting to help others improve their German?<br/> <br/>We are always looking for new care homes to partner with or fluent German speakers who want to share their knowledge of the language and have interesting conversations in doing so.
