# Contributing to Mitein

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to Mitein!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the development team is available via a handful of different channels.

See the [Feedback Channels](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feedback-Channels) wiki page for details on how to share your thoughts.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem on Mitein? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can report your issue as effectively as possible.

All issues should be reported in the [Issues](https://github.com/Simba14/mitein/issues) section of this repository.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Simba14/mitein/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- 👍 - upvote
- 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.
Therefore, it is important that all areas of the issue template are populated.

Please include the following with each issue:

- The browser or device you are experiencing the problem

- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

- Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

- Errors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

## Contributing Fixes & Adding New Features

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues or adding a new feature, follow the guidelines in our [README](https://github.com/Simba14/mitein/blob/main/README.md), to get set up.
Please also comment on an issue or feature request, or if one doesn't exist, create one before starting to code.
All progress and findings should be also be communicated via the issue / feature section.

### Creating Pull Requests

To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and link the issue in the pull request.
Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause. Be sure to follow our Coding Guidelines and keep code changes as small as possible. Avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified otherwise.
Pull requests should contain tests whenever possible.
