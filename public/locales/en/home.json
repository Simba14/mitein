    "content": "Mitein, short for Miteinander, means \"With one another\" in German.\n\n    Mitein’s core purpose is to bring people together, bridging disconnected sections of society by creating spaces for conversations that are inclusive and inter-generational.\n\n    Society is now intertwined with the unbelievable progress of technology, and the explosion of the internet has connected us all in unimaginable ways. We are constantly connected.\n\n    Yet, despite this constant and immediate connectivity, large sections of society feel more disconnected than ever before. Feelings of isolationism, loneliness and lack of meaningful interactions are widespread and deepening. Issues that have been amplified by the pandemic, and experienced by us all in some form from the resulting lockdowns.\n\n    Mitein wants to help undo these harmful trends, by providing avenues and establishing connections that help fortify a sense of community, ultimately bringing people together in meaningful ways.\n\n    Community is at the heart of Mitein. Therefore, collaboration with and support of other social organizations is central to our mission. There are so many initiatives that are doing incredible work within and for local communities. Helping them shouldn’t be difficult.\n    We want to make it easier.\n\n    That’s why at Mitein, whilst also undertaking our own projects, we want to highlight and promote other organisations that you should know about.

    "content": "Mitein looks to connect you to people you’d otherwise never have the fortune of chatting with.\n\n    The goal is to improve people’s German whilst providing human connection to those who currently find themselves socially isolated or just want a chat.\n\n   At present, chats are held online via a video call, but Mitein’s main aim is to increase in-person interactions.\n\n   By partnering with retirement homes and similar organizations, Mitein will help these services easily arrange and manage visits and events safely.\n\n   The first step towards facilitating intergenerational spaces in local communities, whilst integrating a large community of older adults that feel neglected and sidelined.\n\n   We want to create conversations that otherwise wouldn’t take place. Conversations that are purposeful, enjoyable and build confidence.\n\n    Mitein is a foundation. It is free to use."
