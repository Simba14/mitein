This is the frontend repository written in React, which utilises the Gatsby framework.
Gatsby is a static site generator (it creates a single HTML file with the required assets at build time).
This means page loads are very quick. In addition to its performance benefits, it was also chosen for its accessibility, SSR, and
security features. You can learn more about Gatsby through their [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd mitein/
    yarn dev
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!


## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the some of the important Gatsby specific top-level files and directories.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

2.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

3.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

4.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

5.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.


## Environment variables

Gatsby uses two separate env files. 
- `.env.development` - file used when developing locally i.e. using `yarn dev`
- `.env.production` - files used for production environment i.e using `yarn build`
Please, request the actual values for the environment variables and replace them accordingly.

Note: OS Env Variables that are needed to be accessed in browser Javascript, need to be prefixed with `GATSBY_`. Learn more [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/#client-side-javascript)
